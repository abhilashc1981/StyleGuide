# UI Style Guide

This project is a part of Codecademy's full-stack developer path. It's purpose is to create an evolving style guide based on what UI elements have been found to be visually appealing.

It lists:

* Colours that have been found to be visually appealing
* A button that has the look and feel (on click) of a button on a Macbook keyboard
* A list of all the CSS properties that went into achieving the look and feel of the button above, including:

1. width
2. height
3. color
4. background-color
5. font-size
6. border
7. box-shadow
8. border-radius

Also included is the style changing on hovering over the button to give a visual feedback to the user that they are hovering over the button. 

The active button style is also included which visually simulates the depression of a physical button by reducing the box-shadow by 1 pixel on click.
